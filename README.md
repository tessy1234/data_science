# Data Science in Action:
Demonstration of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** applied to real world tasks.

The real world proves the simple fact and this cannot be emphasized enough: 
“Choose the right model for the right problem”.

Data Science has many facets:

1.	Data Engineering:

	a. Big data storage and processing
	
	b. Data pipelines	
	
	c. Model ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
2.	Data Visualization + Statistics:

	a. Reporting
	
	b. Dash Boards
	
	c. Business Analytics
3.	**Machine Learning + Deep Learning**:

	a. Supervised Learning
	
	b. Unsupervised Learning
	
	c. Reinforcement Learning
4.	Cloud Computing:

	a. Storage, compute and scale infrastructure operating on-premise or on any cloud environment (e.g. GCP, Azure, AWS).
	
	b. Possible solutions are on-premise HPC, cloud, multi-cloud or hybrid prem-cloud.
	
	c. Scalability in machine learning and deep learning is concerned with data scalability (instances, features) and computation scalability (iterations, epochs) at training time and user scalability at prediction time.
