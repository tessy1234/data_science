# Data Science in Action:
The repository provides examples for **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** applied to real world tasks.

The real world proves the simple fact and this cannot be emphasized enough: 
“Choose the right model for the right problem”.

Data Science has many facets:

1.	Data Engineering:

	a. Big data storage and processing
	
	b. Data pipelines	
	
	c. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
	
	d. Preprocessing for Machine Learning includes Normalization, Scaling, Imputation, Feature Enhancement, Shuffling
2.	Data Visualization + Statistics:

	a. Reporting
	
	b. Dash Boards
	
	c. Business Analytics
3.	**Machine Learning + Deep Learning**:

	a. Supervised Learning
	
	b. Unsupervised Learning
	
	c. Reinforcement Learning
4.	Cloud Computing:

	a. Storage, compute and scale infrastructure operating on-premise or on any cloud environment (e.g. GCP, Azure, AWS).
	
	b. Possible solutions are on-prem, multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud deployments.
	
	c. Scalability in machine learning and deep learning is concerned with data scalability (instances, features) and computation scalability (iterations, epochs) at training time and user scalability at prediction time.
5.	Quantum Computing:

	Solve intractable problems in various fields.
	
	a.	Simulating quantum mechanics (chemistry, material science) with applications, for example, in artificial photosynthesis, protein folding, lithium ion batteries and high temperature superconductivity.

	b.	Cryptography
	
	c.	Optimization (Quantum Risk Analysis)
	
	d.	Machine Learning (Quantum Variational Classifier)
