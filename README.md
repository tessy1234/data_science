# Data Science in Action:
Demonstration of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** applied to real world tasks.

The real world proves the simple fact and this cannot be emphasized enough: 
“Choose the right model for the right problem”.

Data Science has many facets:

1.	Data Engineering
        a) ETL
	b) Preprocessing, Normalization, Scaling, Imputation, Feature Enhancement, Shuffling
2.	Data Visualization + Statistics
3.	**Machine Learning + Deep Learning**
4.	Cloud Computing
