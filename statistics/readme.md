Goal:
-----
Hypothesis testing.

Problem Statement:
------------------
A)
Observational study, in which researchers observe participants. 
In this case the number of hot wings eaten and beer consumed by patrons of a bar.

Observation: On average men eat more hot wings than women. Is this difference a random or real effect?

B)
Given two independent Gaussian variables X and Y, with probability density functions pdf1 and pdf2, 
then the task ist to calculate: 
Z = X + Y ~ PDF(Z)

Dataset:
--------
Data source: Beerwings.csv

Result:
-------
The claim that men eat more hot wings than women is a real effect.
